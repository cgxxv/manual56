## 8.10.1 InnoDB Buffer Pool Optimization

InnoDB maintains a storage area called the buffer pool for caching data and indexes in memory. Knowing how the InnoDB buffer pool works, and taking advantage of it to keep frequently accessed data in memory, is an important aspect of MySQL tuning.

For an explanation of the inner workings of the InnoDB buffer pool, an overview of its LRU replacement algorithm, and general configuration information, see Section 14.6.3.1, “The InnoDB Buffer Pool”.

For additional InnoDB buffer pool configuration and tuning information, see these sections:

Section 14.6.3.4, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Prefetching (Read-Ahead)”

Section 14.6.3.5, “Configuring InnoDB Buffer Pool Flushing”

Section 14.6.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”

Section 14.6.3.2, “Configuring Multiple Buffer Pool Instances”
